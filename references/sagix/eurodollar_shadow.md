## Dollars without a central bank

In Part 1, we established the Bank War's deepest lesson: the real safe haven was never the asset — it was the market depth that allowed assets to function as money. Jackson destroyed America's deepest liquidity pool, and even holders of physical gold found themselves trapped when the clearing infrastructure evaporated. The Eurodollar story is what happens when the opposite occurs — when a liquidity pool grows so vast, so deep, and so far outside central bank control that it becomes the dominant monetary system on the planet, and nobody realizes it until it seizes.

**By 2016, the Eurodollar market had grown to an estimated $13 trillion in dollar-denominated deposits held in banks outside the United States** [1]. At its peak, there were more Eurodollars than domestic dollars [2]. This offshore shadow system — born from Cold War paranoia, fed by regulatory arbitrage, and ignored by the institutions meant to govern money — is the closest historical precedent for what stablecoins are building today. And the 2008 crisis revealed exactly what happens when this kind of unregulated liquidity pool freezes: **the Federal Reserve had to lend nearly $600 billion through emergency swap lines to foreign central banks** , effectively becoming the lender of last resort for a monetary system it never created and could not directly control [3].

## Cold War origins: the accidental monetary system

### Soviet paranoia creates offshore banking

The Eurodollar market was never designed. It emerged from the intersection of geopolitical fear and regulatory loopholes. In the late 1940s and 1950s, the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries began parking their dollar reserves in European banks — particularly the Paris-based Banque Commerciale pour l'Europe du Nord (BCEN), a Soviet-owned institution whose telex address, "EUROBANK," eventually gave the deposits their name [4]. The motivation was simple: Moscow feared that escalating Cold War tensions could lead Washington to freeze Soviet dollar assets held in American banks, as the US had done with Yugoslav gold in 1948 [5]. By placing dollars in European banks that were beyond US jurisdiction, the Soviets created a parallel dollar system that operated outside the Federal Reserve's control.

### Key players in the shadow dollar's rise

The Eurodollar market had no single architect — it emerged from the convergence of actors whose individual decisions produced a system none of them intended. **Soviet finance officials at BCEN** made the foundational choice: move dollars offshore to avoid seizure risk [4]. **Siegmund Warburg** and the London merchant banking establishment saw opportunity in the regulatory gap, aggressively courting dollar deposits and building London into the market's hub [6]. On the regulatory side, **Regulation Q,** the Federal Reserve rule capping interest rates on domestic deposits, became the structural incentive that drove American corporations and European exporters to move dollars offshore, where European banks could offer higher returns free from reserve requirements and deposit insurance assessments [2]. **The Banque de France** , when approached about regulating the market in 1963, rejected the proposal, preferring to promote Paris as an offshore center and deeming international reform unrealistic [7]. This pattern — national regulators choosing competitive advantage over systemic oversight — allowed the market to grow unchecked.

By the end of the 1960s, Eurodollar deposits had reached $70 billion; **by the mid-1980s, there were more Eurodollars in existence than dollars inside the United States** [2]. The growth accelerated after Nixon ended dollar-gold convertibility in 1971, collapsing the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system. Floating exchange rates created enormous new demand for dollar-denominated hedging instruments, and the Eurodollar market supplied them. **The St. Louis Federal Reserve documented that the Eurodollar market grew over 252% between 1964 and 1969 alone** , measured in constant dollars [8]. What had started as a niche for Soviet paranoia had become the plumbing of global trade.

## The mechanics of shadow money creation

### How Eurodollars work — and why they matter

The crucial insight about Eurodollars is that no actual dollars ever leave the United States. When a depositor places funds in a London bank, the London bank receives a credit on the books of its correspondent bank in New York, which holds reserves at the Federal Reserve [9]. The London bank then lends those dollar credits to other borrowers, who may redeposit them in yet another offshore bank. Each redeposit creates a new Eurodollar liability without any corresponding expansion of the Fed's balance sheet. This process — credit creation through offshore re-lending — is functionally identical to how domestic banks create money through lending, except it happens beyond the reach of Fed reserve requirements, FDIC insurance, and direct regulatory oversight [9].

This means the Eurodollar system was creating dollar-denominated credit on a massive scale with no central bank backstop. As long as confidence held and borrowers repaid, the system functioned smoothly. But in 1974, after the Nixon shock and the collapse of Franklin National Bank, **ten central banks agreed to backstop the Eurodollar market to prevent a run** [2], an early acknowledgment that this unregulated pool had become too large to ignore and too interconnected to let fail.

## The 2008 seizure: when the deepest pool froze

The Eurodollar market's systemic risk was fully exposed during the 2008 financial crisis. European banks had funded enormous portfolios of dollar-denominated assets — including US mortgage-backed securities — with short-term Eurodollar borrowing. When confidence collapsed after Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in September 2008, these banks could not roll over their dollar liabilities [10]. The interbank lending market froze. Banks that needed dollars to service existing obligations could not obtain them at any reasonable price.

![](https://storage.ghost.io/c/dc/15/dc152460-95bc-4abf-b4f4-c7e17de2bad2/content/images/2026/03/Gemini_Generated_Image_jetxrfjetxrfjetx-1.png)

The Federal Reserve's response was unprecedented. Beginning with the ECB and Swiss National Bank in December 2007, the Fed established reciprocal currency swap lines — lending dollars to foreign central banks, who then on-lent them to distressed banks in their jurisdictions [10]. **By December 2008, swap lines outstanding had risen to more than $580 billion, accounting for over 25% of the Fed's total assets** [3]. **The ECB alone drew $300 billion** [11]. In October 2008, the Fed eliminated caps on swap lines for four central banks, offering "full allotments" — effectively unlimited dollar liquidity to institutions it did not regulate, in countries it did not govern [11].

The swap lines worked. **They narrowed the LIBOR-OIS spread by approximately two percentage points** within weeks of the unlimited commitment [12]. But the episode revealed a profound structural vulnerability: the world's dominant monetary system had no lender of last resort by design. The Fed improvised one under crisis conditions, but the swap lines were temporary, discretionary, and politically contentious. **The biggest beneficiaries of the Federal Reserve's emergency lending during the 2008 crisis were not American banks but European ones** [9].

## Modern parallel: stablecoins as the new Eurodollars

### The structural rhyme

The parallels between the Eurodollar market and dollar-pegged stablecoins are not metaphorical — they are structural. Both create dollar-denominated value outside the US banking system. Both emerge from regulatory arbitrage and serve populations that cannot easily access domestic dollar infrastructure. Both operate with lighter regulatory oversight than onshore equivalents. And both grow fastest precisely because they solve real problems that the traditional system cannot.

**Tether (USDT), with a market cap exceeding $162 billion and over 400 million users** , functions as what some analysts call a "retail Eurodollar for the digital age" [13]. Like a 1960s London bank that accepted Soviet dollar deposits outside US jurisdiction, Tether — incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, headquartered in El Salvador — accepts dollars and issues digital tokens that circulate globally on public blockchains without touching the US banking system. The Eurodollar market is currently roughly 80 times larger than Tether, but the growth trajectory and structural function are converging [13].

The demand drivers are identical to those that built the original Eurodollar market. Citizens in Argentina, Venezuela, Nigeria, and Turkey use USDT the way 1950s European exporters used Eurodollar deposits — as access to dollar stability that their domestic financial systems cannot provide [13]. **The stablecoin market now totals approximately $250 billion, backed by roughly $180 billion in US Treasuries** [14]. **Tether itself has become the world's seventh-largest buyer of US Treasury securities** , surpassing entire countries including Canada, Switzerland, and Germany [13].

### The missing swap line

Here is where the Eurodollar analogy becomes a warning rather than a comfort. When the Eurodollar market seized in 2008, the Federal Reserve stepped in with swap lines because the offshore dollar system had become too interconnected with the onshore economy to allow it to fail. European banks held American mortgage-backed securities; American money market funds held European bank commercial paper; the contagion channels ran in both directions.

Stablecoins have no equivalent backstop. If a crisis of confidence triggered mass redemptions of USDT — whether from a regulatory crackdown, a reserve transparency scandal, or a geopolitical shock — there is no central bank swap line to provide emergency dollar liquidity to stablecoin holders in emerging markets. Tether's reserves sit in US bank deposits and Treasury bills, but those reserves are not backed by FDIC insurance (Tether's banking relationships are offshore), and the Fed has no mandate or mechanism to backstop stablecoin issuers the way it backstopped European central banks in 2008 [15]. The pool is deep — but it has no floor.

## Portfolio lessons: liquidity without a lender of last resort

### The Eurodollar lesson for DeFi positioning

Part 1 argued that the safe haven is the pool, not the token. The Eurodollar story adds a critical qualification: **pools without backstops are only as safe as the confidence that sustains them.** The Eurodollar system functioned beautifully for decades — providing dollar liquidity globally, facilitating trade, and generating returns for depositors — until the moment it didn't. In September 2008, the confidence evaporated in days. Only the Fed's willingness to improvise a global lender-of-last-resort function prevented a complete collapse of offshore dollar intermediation.

For DeFi portfolio construction, this translates to a specific risk hierarchy. Centralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC represent deep, liquid pools — the Eurodollars of crypto. Their liquidity is genuine, their utility is enormous, and their role in facilitating DeFi is indispensable. But they carry a tail risk that mirrors the Eurodollar system's 2008 vulnerability: in a crisis severe enough to trigger mass redemptions, there is no Fed swap line to backstop the system. The liquidity you depend on for exit may be the same liquidity everyone else is trying to access simultaneously.

### The oracle and the clearing house

In Part 1 we noted that market depth and oracle reliability are two halves of the same liquidity equation. The Eurodollar crisis adds a third variable: the clearing infrastructure that connects pools to each other. In 2008, it wasn't just that individual banks lacked dollars — it was that the interbank lending channels through which dollars normally circulated had frozen. Banks with dollars refused to lend them; banks without dollars couldn't access them at any price. The pools existed, but the pipes between them had collapsed.

In DeFi, this maps directly to bridge infrastructure and cross-chain settlement. A stablecoin pool on Ethereum and a stablecoin pool on Solana may each have adequate depth individually. But if the bridge connecting them fails during a crisis — or if bridge operators halt transactions during volatility — the pools become isolated silos. Jackson's pet banks, the Eurodollar freeze, and cross-chain fragmentation are all manifestations of the same underlying risk: liquidity is only as good as the infrastructure that connects it, and that infrastructure is most likely to fail precisely when you need it most.

### Positioning for the stablecoin's Bretton Woods moment

The Eurodollar market's history suggests that unregulated offshore dollar systems eventually face a reckoning that forces formalization. The 1974 central bank agreement to backstop Eurodollars, the 2008 swap lines, and the subsequent permanent standing arrangements between the Fed and five major central banks all represent steps toward bringing the shadow system under institutional oversight — without destroying it.

Stablecoins appear to be approaching a similar inflection point. In the United States, legislation to regulate stablecoin issuers — requiring Treasury-backed reserves and compliance frameworks — is advancing [14]. The question for DeFi participants is not whether regulation will come, but how the transition from shadow system to regulated infrastructure will affect liquidity, access, and yield. Those who studied the Eurodollar's evolution from Soviet parking lot to regulated global infrastructure understand that formalization does not kill the market — it reshapes it. The institutions that survived the Eurodollar's formalization were those that had already built compliance capabilities and reserve transparency. The same filter will likely apply to stablecoins.

But even deep pools with backstops face a risk that only becomes visible when you try to move between them. Part 3 examines the invisible pipes.
